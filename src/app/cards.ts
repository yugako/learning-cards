    in terms of machine-code at a much higher level.Certain paradigms are better suited for certain types of problems,

We can determine:
static (compile-time) polymorphism / overloading:
one method of one class has several implementations depending on its params;
dynamic (run time) polymorphism / overriding
several methods in the relations subclass-superclass can have different implementations with exactly the same name and params, so subclass's method overrides superclass's method.

    question: 'Composition over inheritance<br>',
    answer: `Software development is mostly about a function composition or an object composition. Hence we compare it with inheritance let's talk about object composition here. It refers to combining objects into more complex ones.
Cons of inheritance:
The tight coupling problem: Because child classes are dependent on the implementation of the parent class, class inheritance is the tightest coupling available in object-oriented design.
The fragile base class problem: Due to tight coupling, changes to the base class can potentially break a large number of descendant classes — potentially in code managed by third parties. The author could break code they’re not aware of.
The inflexible hierarchy problem: With single ancestor taxonomies, given enough time and evolution, all class taxonomies are eventually wrong for new use-cases.
The duplication by necessity problem: Due to inflexible hierarchies, new use cases are often implemented by duplication, rather than extension, leading to similar classes which are unexpectedly divergent. Once duplication sets in, it’s not obvious which class new classes should descend from or why.
The gorilla/banana problem: “…the problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.” ~ Joe Armstrong, “Coders at Work”

      One of great examples is NgRx store which returns the new instance of store state.

      + '<br><br> Another explanation: <br>'  +`Immutability in OOP and FP is a property of an object state being unable to change.

Weak immutability
The state of an object consists of two parts: its fields (shape/type) and its values (appearance/instance). If an object's shape cannot be changed but its appearance can - we call this weak immutability. In JavaScript, objects are high mutable by design. We can alter their shape as well as their appearance.

Strong immutability
In contrast, strong immutability means the impossibility of changing anything about an object's state, neither fields nor values.

Tail code optimization takes a recursive function and generate an iterative function using “goto” internally, and then execute it. It does not limit the stack calls because there are none and the function is not a recursive function more. The performance of this iterative function is equivalent to its recursive function.
In other words, tail call optimization means that it is possible to call a function from another function without growing the call stack.`,

    answer: `FP pros and cons
Disadvantages
There is no efficient vocabulary for functional languages. Purely functional vocabularies work slower than the hash tables, and for some applications, this can be critical. Secondly, there is no purely functional weak hash map. Nevertheless, for most developers, this defect may remain unnoticed.
Functional programming is not suitable for algorithms in graphs (due to slow work) and in general for those solutions that for decades were based on imperative programming.
Check the lists of FP disadvantages on Quora and in the article by Alexander Alvin too.
Okay, the last point we mentioned is not very related to cons because we cannot blame functional programming for what it was not meant to be.
Advantages
Functional programming is famous for its high-level abstractions that hide a large number of details of such routine operations like iterating. This makes the code shorter and, as a consequence, guarantees a smaller number of errors that can be tolerated.
In the functional programming, there is a smaller number of language primitives. Well-known classes are not used in FP. Instead of creating a unique description of an object with operations in the form of methods, in functional programming, there are several basic language primitives that are well optimized inside.
Due to the language and structures flexibility, as a functional programming developer, you can bring the language closer to the problem. And not vice versa. In addition, FP offers some new and interesting tools for solving complex tasks that OOP developers often neglect.
Working with functional languages provides accurate and fast code writing, facilitates testing and debugging. You’re working with high-level programs, and the functions signatures are more informative.`,

    Reactive programming is mostly like Functional programming where functions and data are combined with time and called streams. We can create a stream from anything: array, primitive value, etc. We can merge streams, composite them, have HoS (high order stream) which takes another stream as an input or gives as a result.
  A stream is a sequence of ongoing events ordered in time. Streams can emit three things: a value (of some type), an error, or a "completed" signal. To capture these emits you subscribe to a stream passing a function called observers (Observer design pattern).
On top of that ideas, we have a bunch of functions to help us handle streams with all the power of functionality.`,

    question: 'Порівняти HTTP 1 і HTTP 2 і HTTP 3',
    answer: `From a technical point of view, one of the most significant features that distinguishes HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is the binary framing layer, which can be thought of as a part of the application layer in the internet protocol stack. As opposed to HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format, HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format, while still maintaining HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers.
    <br>
    <div class="markdown-body">
    <h2>HTTP versions and their features</h2>
    <h3>HTTP 0.9</h3>
    <p>1991</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Client-server, request-response protocol.</li>
    <li>ASCII protocol, running over a TCP/IP link.</li>
    <li>Designed to transfer hypertext documents (HTML).</li>
    <li><strong>The connection between server and client is closed after every request.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HTTP/1.0</h3>
    <p>1995</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Versioning information (HTTP/1.0) is now sent within each request</li>
    <li>HTTP headers: both request and response may consist of multiple newline-separated header fields.</li>
    <li>Response object is prefixed with a response status code line.</li>
    <li>Response object is not limited to plain HTML (thanks to the Content-Type header).</li>
    <li><strong>The connection between server and client is closed after every request.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
    HTTP/1.1</h3>
    <p>1997</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>A connection can be reused.</strong></li>
    <li>Pipelining has been added, allowing to send a second request before the answer for the first one is fully transmitted.</li>
    <li>An average limitation (depends on browser) is a maximum of <strong>6 simultaneously connections per server</strong>.</li>
    <li>Chunked responses (split into 256 bytes) are now also supported.</li>
    <li>Additional cache control mechanisms have been introduced.</li>
    <li>Content negotiation, including language, encoding, or type, has been introduced and allows a client and a server to agree on the most adequate content to exchange.</li>
    <li>Thanks to the Host header, the ability to host different domains at the same IP address now allows server colocation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
    HTTP/2</h3>
    <p>2015</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It is a binary protocol rather than text.</li>
    <li>It is a multiplexed protocol. Parallel requests can be handled over the same connection. Frames are part of streams, and streams are identified by a number. The stream number is present in each frame as a binary field. Streams allow matching requests to responses.</li>
    <li>Due to multiplexing only <strong>1 connection per server</strong> is allowed.</li>
    <li>It compresses headers. As these are often similar among a set of requests.</li>
    <li>Server push: mechanism, allowing the server to send the required resources before they are requested by the client. So by the time the browser finishes parsing HTML, the transfer of CSS or js would have already started or even completed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2016</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Support of Alt-Svc allows the dissociation of the identification and the location of a given resource, allowing for a smarter CDN caching mechanism.</li>
    <li>The introduction of Client-Hints allows the browser, or client, to proactively communicate information about its requirements, or hardware constraints, to the server.</li>
    <li>The introduction of security-related prefixes in the Cookie header now helps guarantee a secure cookie has not been altered.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
    HTTP/3</h3>
    <p>upcoming</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It is built over QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections). On the surface, QUIC is very similar to TCP+TLS+HTTP/2 implemented on UDP</li>
    <li>Dramatically reduced connection establishment time</li>
    <li>Improved congestion control</li>
    <li>Multiplexing without a head of line blocking</li>

    question: 'Що таке GraphQL. Pros & Cons',
    answer: `GraphQL is a language for querying data. Unlike most query languages (such as SQL), you don’t use GraphQL to query a particular type of data store (such as a MySQL database). Instead, you use GraphQL to query data from any number of different sources.
    <br>GraphQL is a query language and a server-side runtime (typically served over HTTP).
    <br>The runtime part points to the fact that a GraphQL API runs on a server.
    In a GraphQL API, we shape our data within a strictly typed schema, telling it how to resolve data when asked for. To GraphQL, where data comes from doesn’t matter. It could be from a database, micro-service, or even an underlying RESTful API.
    <br>Known problems <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <strong>Authorization</strong>. Not implemented from the box. It's not evident how to implement it properly. As for identification, JWT is a common choice.</li>
    <li>
    <strong>N+1 problem</strong>. With nesting, requests may affect performance getting information by separate requests to the DB. To overcome, it may use the <strong>DataLoader</strong> utility. DataLoader batches requests and caches the results.</li>
    <li>
    <strong>API complexity</strong>. Bad GraphQL API is much worse than a bad REST API. It's a great effort to build a good one.</li>
    <li>
    <strong>Bundle size</strong>. GraphQL requests include in the bundle.</li>
    <li>
    <strong>Versioning</strong>. There is no out-of-the-box solution for it.</li>
    </ul><br>A simple GraphQL server comes without a built-in caching or batching mechanism.
    <br>Since in GraphQL there is no built-in solution, the developer also needs to handle pagination and authorization.
    Unlike GraphQL, the great advantage of REST API is that it's pretty clear and easy to understand. It’s highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.

    question: 'Man in the middle attack (MITM)',
    answer: `The MITM is an attack with an interceptor in between two communicating hosts.<br> <br>
    Types:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Rogue Access Point.</strong> Devices equipped with wireless cards will often try to auto-connect to the access point that is emitting the strongest signal. Attackers can set up their own wireless access point and trick nearby devices to join its domain.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>ARP Spoofing.</strong> It is used to resolve Network layer (Layer 3) addresses to Link layer (Layer 2) addresses in a local area network. Most often it's IP address to MAC (media access control) address. When a host needs to talk to a host with a given IP address, it references the ARP cache to resolve the IP address to a MAC address. If the address is not known, a request is made asking for the MAC address of the device with the IP address.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>mDNS Spoofing.</strong> Multicast DNS is similar to DNS, but it’s done on a local area network (LAN) using a broadcast like ARP. This makes it a perfect target for spoofing attacks. Devices such as TVs, printers, and entertainment systems make use of this protocol since they are typically on trusted networks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>DNS Spoofing.</strong> Similar to the way ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses on a LAN, DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses. When using a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker attempts to introduce corrupt DNS cache information to a host in an attempt to access another host using their domain name.</p>

    category: "security"

  {
    question: 'Які є методи засоби для взлому MITM',
    answer: `Attack techniques <br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Sniffing.</strong> Attackers use packet capture tools to inspect packets at a low level. Using specific wireless devices that are allowed to be put into monitoring or promiscuous mode can allow an attacker to see packets that are not intended for it to see, such as packets addressed to other hosts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Packet Injection.</strong> An attacker can also leverage their device’s monitoring mode to inject malicious packets into data communication streams. Packet injection usually involves first sniffing to determine how and when to craft and send packets.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Session Hijacking.</strong> Most web applications use a login mechanism that generates a temporary session token to use for future requests to avoid requiring the user to type a password on every page. An attacker can sniff sensitive traffic to identify the session token for a user and use it to make requests as the user.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>SSL Stripping.</strong> The SSL Strip takes advantage of the way most users come to SSL websites. The majority of visitors connect to a website’s page that redirects through a 302 redirect, or they arrive on an SSL page via a link from a non-SSL site. If the victim wants, for instance, to buy a product and types the URL <a href="http://www.buyme.com" rel="nofollow">www.buyme.com</a> in the address bar, the browser connects to the attacker's machine and waits for a response from the server. In an SSL Strip, the attacker, in turn, forwards the victim’s request to the online shop’s server and receives the secure HTTPS payment page. For example <a href="https://www.buyme.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.buyme.com</a>. At this point, the attacker has complete control over the secure payment page. He downgrades it from HTTPS to HTTP and sends it back to the victim’s browser. The browser is now redirected to <a href="http://www.buyme.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.buyme.com</a>. From now onward, all the victim’s data will be transferred in plain text format, and the attacker will be able to intercept it.</p>

    question: 'Що таке CORS',
    answer: `Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain. It extends and adds flexibility to the same-origin policy (SOP). However, it also provides potential for cross-domain attacks, if a website's CORS policy is poorly configured and implemented. CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    <br><br>
    Same-Origin Policy<br>
    The same-origin policy is a security mechanism that generally restricts how a script (javaScript) on some web page (one origin) can interact with a different web page (another origin).
    <br>
    The origin is a combination of a protocol, host and port of a web-page URL. The same-origin means: identical protocol (e.g., https), identical host (e.g. mail.google.com), and identical port (e.g. 80).
    <br>
    The same-origin policy is oriented mostly against embedding legal web pages into criminals' web pages, making fake banking sites, for example. Legal sites may be totally mocked (e.g., via iframe) or some of their functionality may be borrowed with help of hidden elements, like buttons, forms.
    <br>
    The same-origin policy doesn't prevent embedding cross-origin scripts, images, forms, iframes. It only will be forbidden by default for any script on a web page to read any cross-origin resources such as iframe (data from it), image (loading to a canvas or background) and to make requests to cross-origin APIs.
    <br>
    The protection of something like malicious image src attribute is not a same-origin policy business. It's up to Content Security Policy.`,

    Injection (SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, OS) occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. Filtering and validating untrusted input, escaping special characters are effective protective measures. <br>
    An application is vulnerable to attack when:

    question: 'XSS атака. Що це? Її види, як захиститись (як юзер і як дев)?',
    answer: `Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a code injection attack that allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript in another user's browser.
      <br>
      The attacker does not directly target his victim. Instead, he exploits a vulnerability in a website that the victim visits, in order to get the website to deliver the malicious JavaScript for him. To the victim's browser, the malicious JavaScript appears to be a legitimate part of the website, and the website has thus acted as an unintentional accomplice to the attacker.`
      + `<br>
       <b>Types of XSS</b>
       While the goal of an XSS attack is always to execute malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser, there are few fundamentally different ways of achieving that goal. XSS attacks are often divided into three types:
       <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Persistent XSS</strong>, where the malicious string originates from the website's database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Reflected XSS</strong>, where the malicious string originates from the victim's request.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>DOM-based XSS</strong>, where the vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the server-side code.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Persistent XSS:</b> where the malicious string originates from the website's database. The HTML code will be referred to as the malicious string or the malicious script. It is important to note that the string itself is only malicious if it ultimately gets parsed as HTML in the victim's browser, which can only happen as the result of an XSS vulnerability in the website.
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The attacker uses one of the website's forms to insert a malicious string into the website's database.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The victim requests a page from the website.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The website includes the malicious string from the database in the response and sends it to the victim.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The victim's browser executes the malicious script inside the response, sending the victim's cookies to the attacker's server.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <b>Reflected XSS:</b> where the malicious string originates from the victim's request to the website. The website then includes this malicious string in the response sent back to the user.
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><p>The attacker crafts a URL containing a malicious string and sends it to the victim.</p></li>
            <li><p>The victim is tricked by the attacker into requesting the URL from the website.</p></li>
            <li><p>The website includes the malicious string from the URL in the response.</p></li>
            <li><p>The victim's browser executes the malicious script inside the response, sending the victim's cookies to the attacker's server.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <b>DOM-based XSS:</b> where the vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the server-side code. DOM-based XSS is a variant of both persistent and reflected XSS. In a DOM-based XSS attack, the malicious string is not actually parsed by the victim's browser until the website's legitimate JavaScript is executed.

            <li><p>The attacker crafts a URL containing a malicious string and sends it to the victim.</p></li>

    question: 'Vulnerable and Outdated Components атака. Як щоб превентати?',
    answer: `Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defences and enable various attacks and impacts. Avoid weird stuff from untrusted sources which you often do not need and if you can't - keep it up-to-date and use automated tools to validate the sources.
    <br><br>
        You are volnurable if :
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
          <p>If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both
          client-side and server-side). This includes components you directly
          use as well as nested dependencies.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>If the software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. This
          includes the OS, web/application server, database management system
          (DBMS), applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments,
          and libraries.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to
          security bulletins related to the components you use.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks,
          and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly
          happens in environments when patching is a monthly or quarterly task
          under change control, leaving organizations open to days or months
          of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated,

          <br>
          How to prevent: <br>

          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and
          server-side components (e.g., frameworks, libraries) and their
          dependencies using tools like versions, OWASP Dependency Check,
          retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like Common Vulnerability and
          Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for
          vulnerabilities in the components. Use software composition analysis
          tools to automate the process. Subscribe to email alerts for
          security vulnerabilities related to components you use.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Only obtain components from official sources over secure links.
          Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a modified,
          malicious component (See A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity
          Failures).</p>

          <p>Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not
           create security patches for older versions. If patching is not

    question: 'SSDLC',
    answer: `A Secure SDLC requires adding security testing at each software development stage, from design, to development, to deployment and beyond. Examples include designing applications to ensure that your architecture will be secure, as well as including security risk factors as part of the initial planning phase.
    <br>
    Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) describes how software applications are built. It usually contains the following phases: <br>
    <ul><li><strong>Requirements</strong> gathering</li><li><strong>Design</strong> of new features based on the requirements</li><li><strong>Development</strong> of new capabilities (writing code to meet requirements)</li><li><strong>Verification</strong> of new capabilities—confirming that they do indeed meet the requirements</li><li><strong>Maintenance and evolution</strong> of these capabilities once the release goes out the door</li></ul>

    <br>
    <strong>PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS</strong>
    <ul><li><strong>Sample functional requirement:</strong> user needs the ability to verify their contact information before they are able to renew their membership.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sample security consideration</strong>: users should be able to see only their own contact information and no one else’s.</li></ul>
    <strong>PHASE 2: DESIGN</strong>
    <ul><li><strong>Sample functional design:</strong> page should retrieve the user’s name, email, phone, and address from CUSTOMER_INFO table in the database and display it on screen.</li><li><strong>Sample security concern:</strong> we must verify that the user has a valid session token before retrieving information from the database. If absent, the user should be redirected to the login page.</li></ul>
    <strong>PHASE 3: DEVELOPMENT</strong>
    <br>
    Secure coding guidelines, in this case, may include:
    <ul><li>Using parameterized, read-only SQL queries to read data from the database and minimize chances that anyone can ever commandeer these queries for nefarious purposes</li><li>Validating user inputs before processing data contained in them</li><li>Sanitizing any data that’s being sent back out to the user from the database</li><li>Checking open source libraries for vulnerabilities before using them</li></ul>
    <strong>PHASE 4: VERIFICATION</strong>
    <br>
    Verification at this phase may include:
    <ul><li>Automated tests that express the critical paths of your application</li><li>Automated execution of application unit tests that verify the correctness of the underlying application</li><li>Automated deployment tools that dynamically swap in application secrets to be used in a production environment</li></ul>
    <strong>PHASE 5: MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION</strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong>5 Secure SDLC Best Practices</strong>
    <br>
    1. EDUCATE YOUR DEVELOPERS<br>
    2. HAVE CLEAR REQUIREMENTS <br>
    3. MAINTAIN A GROWTH MINDSET <br>
    4. TIE IMPLEMENTATION TO OTHER INITIATIVES <br>

    question: 'Security Misconfiguration атака. Як превентати?',
    answer: `XML External Entities (XEE) Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. Protection golden rule - avoid XML =) If it's not the case keep XML processors up-to-date, disable evaluation of external entities, implement whitelisting server-side input validation, use special tools.
    <br>
    Security Misconfiguration This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or incorrect configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. To avoid simply don't do this shit, automate configuring environments, use different credentials, do not install any unnecessary features, keep all up-to-date, use automated control of configuration integrity.<br>
    The application might be volnurable if:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the
    application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud
    services.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary
    ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and
    unchanged.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative
    error messages to users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or
    not configured securely.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The security settings in the application servers, application
    frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases,
    etc., are not set to secure values.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are
    not set to secure values.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The software is out of date or vulnerable (see <a href="../A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/">A06:2021-Vulnerable

    </ul>
    How to prevent:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>A repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy
    another environment that is appropriately locked down. Development,
    QA, and production environments should all be configured
    identically, with different credentials used in each environment.
    This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to
    set up a new secure environment.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components,
    documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features
    and frameworks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all
    security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management
    process (see <a href="../A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/">A06:2021-Vulnerable
    and Outdated Components</a>). Review
    cloud storage permissions (e.g., S3 bucket permissions).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A segmented application architecture provides effective and secure
    separation between components or tenants, with segmentation,
    containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Sending security directives to clients, e.g., Security Headers.</p>

    Broken authentication incorrect implementation of authentication or session management. To avoid, use multi-factor authentication, strong passwords, properly store and don't exposure credentials, limit, delay and log login attempts, limit session lifetime, use strong session IDs, rotate them on login.
    <br>
    There may be authentication weaknesses if the application:
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Permits automated attacks such as credential stuffing, where the
      attacker has a list of valid usernames and passwords.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Permits brute force or other automated attacks.</p>

      or "admin/admin".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Uses weak or ineffective credential recovery and forgot-password
      processes, such as "knowledge-based answers," which cannot be made

      </ul>
      <br>
      How to Prevent:
      <ul>
      <li>

      <li>
      <p>Implement weak password checks, such as testing new or changed
      passwords against the top 10,000 worst passwords list.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Align password length, complexity, and rotation policies with
      National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
      800-63b's guidelines in section 5.1.1 for Memorized Secrets or other
      modern, evidence-based password policies.</p>

      <li>
      <p>Ensure registration, credential recovery, and API pathways are
      hardened against account enumeration attacks by using the same
      messages for all outcomes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts, but be careful not to create a denial of service scenario. Log all failures
      and alert administrators when credential stuffing, brute force, or
      other attacks are detected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Use a server-side, secure, built-in session manager that generates a
      new random session ID with high entropy after login. Session identifier
      should not be in the URL, be securely stored, and invalidated after
      logout, idle, and absolute timeouts.</p>

    question: 'Software and Data Integrity Failures (old name - Insecure Deserialization) атака. Як превентати?',
    answer: `
    Insecure Deserialization Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution or replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. The only safe architectural pattern is not to accept serialized objects from untrusted sources or to use serialization mediums that only permit primitive data types.
    <br>
    Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied to the previously trusted application. Attackers could potentially upload their own updates to be distributed and run on all installations. Another example is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
    <br>
    How to prevent:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the software or data is from the expected source and has not been altered.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Ensure libraries and dependencies, such as npm or Maven, are
    consuming trusted repositories. If you have a higher risk profile, consider hosting an internal known-good repository that's vetted.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Ensure that a software supply chain security tool, such as OWASP
    Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX, is used to verify that
    components do not contain known vulnerabilities</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Ensure that there is a review process for code and configuration changes to minimize the chance that malicious code or configuration could be introduced into your software pipeline.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline has proper segregation, configuration, and access
    control to ensure the integrity of the code flowing through the
    build and deploy processes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Ensure that unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to
    untrusted clients without some form of integrity check or digital
    signature to detect tampering or replay of the serialized data</p>

    question: 'Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (old name - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring) атака. Як привентати?',
    answer: `
    Insufficient Logging & Monitoring lack of logging and monitoring allows attackers to do their job. All red flags should be logged in a manageable manner, the monitoring system should be able to react in real-time. It's good to use protection frameworks for such purposes.
    <br>
     Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs any time:
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value
      transactions, are not logged.</p>
      </li>

      messages.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious
      activity.</p>

      <li>
      <p>Logs are only stored locally.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes
      are not in place or effective.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Penetration testing and scans by dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools (such as OWASP ZAP) do
      not trigger alerts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      suspicious or malicious accounts and held for enough time to allow
      delayed forensic analysis.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Ensure that logs are generated in a format that log management
      solutions can easily consume.</p>

      <li>
      <p>Ensure log data is encoded correctly to prevent injections or
      attacks on the logging or monitoring systems.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Ensure high-value transactions have an audit trail with integrity

      <p>In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser) to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic , where credentials is the Base64 encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon :.</p>

      <p>As the user ID and password are passed over the network as clear text (it is base64 encoded, but base64 is a reversible encoding), the basic authentication scheme is not secure. HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication. Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used to protect sensitive or valuable information.</p>
      <p>Because the BA field has to be sent in the header of each HTTP request, the web browser needs to cache credentials for a reasonable period of time to avoid constantly prompting the user for their username and password. Caching policy differs between browsers.</p>
      <p>HTTP does not provide a method for a web server to instruct the client to "log out" the user.</p>

      <p>While browsing the web, you've almost certainly come across sites that let you log in using your social media account. The chances are that this feature is built using the popular OAuth 2.0 framework.</p>
      <p>The basic OAuth process is widely used to integrate third-party functionality that requires access to certain data from a user's account. For example, an application might use OAuth to request access to your email contacts list so that it can suggest people to connect with. However, the same mechanism is also used to provide third-party authentication services, allowing users to log in with an account that they have with a different website.</p>
      <p>OAuth 2.0 was originally developed as a way of sharing access to specific data between applications. It works by defining a series of interactions between three distinct parties, namely a client application, a resource owner, and the OAuth service provider.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <strong>Client application</strong> - The website or web application that wants to access the user's data.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>Resource owner</strong> - The user whose data the client application wants to access.</li>
      <li>
      <strong>OAuth service provider</strong> - The website or application that controls the user's data and access to it. They support OAuth by providing an API for interacting with both an authorization server and a resource server.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Although not originally intended for this purpose, OAuth has evolved into a means of authenticating users as well.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>The user chooses the option to log in with their social media account. The client application then uses the social media site's OAuth service to request access to some data that it can use to identify the user. This could be the email address that is registered with their account, for example.</li>
      <li>After receiving an access token, the client application requests this data from the resource server, typically from a dedicated /userinfo endpoint.</li>
      <li>Once it has received the data, the client application uses it in place of a username to log the user in. The access token that it received from the authorization server is often used instead of a traditional password.</li>

      <ul>
      <li>Require client applications to register a whitelist of valid redirect_uris. Wherever possible, use strict byte-for-byte comparison to validate the URI in any incoming requests. Only allow complete and exact matches rather than using pattern matching. This prevents attackers from accessing other pages on the whitelisted domains.</li>
      <li>Enforce the use of the state parameter. Its value should also be bound to the user's session by including some unguessable, session-specific data, such as a hash containing the session cookie. This helps protect users against CSRF-like attacks. It also makes it much more difficult for an attacker to use any stolen authorization codes.</li>
      <li>On the resource server, make sure you verify that the access token was issued to the same client_id that is making the request. You should also check the scope being requested to make sure that this matches the scope for which the token was originally granted.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
      <li>Make sure you fully understand the details of how OAuth works before implementing it. Many vulnerabilities are caused by a simple lack of understanding of what exactly is happening at each stage and how this can potentially be exploited.</li>
      <li>Use the state parameter even though it is not mandatory.</li>
      <li>Send a redirect_uri parameter not only to the /authorization endpoint but also to the /token endpoint.</li>
      <li>When developing mobile or native desktop OAuth client applications, it is often not possible to keep the client_secret private. In these situations, the PKCE (RFC7638) mechanism may be used to provide additional protection against access code interception or leakage.</li>
      <li>If you use the OpenID Connect id_token, make sure it is properly validated according to the JSON Web Signature, JSON Web Encryption, and OpenID specifications.</li>
      <li>Be careful with authorization codes - they may be leaked via Referer headers when external images, scripts, or CSS content is loaded. It is also important to not include them in the dynamically generated JavaScript files as they may be executed from external domains via &lt;script&gt; tags.</li>

    question: 'OAUTH переваги',
    answer: `
    Features of OAUTH:
    <ol>
    <li>It allows you to read data of a user from another application.</li>
    <li>It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices.</li>
    <li>Is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.</li>
    <li>It gives users more control over their data; they can selectively grant access to various functionalities for applications they want to use.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Advantages of OAUTH:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>This flexible protocol relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure data between the web server and browsers remain private.</li>
    <li>SSL uses cryptography industry protocols to keep data safe.</li>
    <li>It uses tokenization to give limited access to the user's data. For example, instead of storing credit card information on Amazon’s web site, the credit card number, security code and consumer name are each given “token” IDs. The tokens are given to the merchant, not the actual data.</li>
    <li>It is easy to implement and provides strong authentication. In addition to the two-factor authentication, tokens can be revoked if necessary (ie, suspicious activity).</li>
    <li>Uses single sign on</li>
    </ul>`,

  {
    question: 'Що таке Single sign-on (SSO)?',
    answer: `
    Single sign-on (SSO) is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials -- for example, a name and password -- to access multiple applications. SSO can be used by enterprises, smaller organizations and individuals to ease the management of various usernames and passwords.

  {
    question: 'Bearer VS JWT token',
    answer: `
    JWT is an encoding standard for tokens that contains a JSON data payload that can be signed and encrypted.
<br>
JWT can be used for many things, among those are bearer tokens, i.e. a piece of information that you can present to some service that by virtue of you having it (you being the "bearer") grants you access to something.
<br>
Bearer tokens can be included in an HTTP request in different ways, one of them (probably the preferred one) being the Authorization header. But you could also put it into a request parameter, a cookie or the request body. That is mostly between you and the server you are trying to access.`
