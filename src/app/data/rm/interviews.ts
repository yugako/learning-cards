    question: 'Let’s imagine, when interviewing, you can’t find a common language with the candidate. What would be your recommendations?',
    answer: `
      I had this situation several times. For example, there was a case when candidate didn't want to follow the interview agenda. <br />
      And he was constantly saying that he knows all these things and there is no need to check it. Main points here: stay profesional and do not allow the
      candidate to take an initiative on the interview.

  {
    question: 'Would you hire the person you don’t like?',
    answer: `
      It depends on the reason why I don't like this person. For example, if candidate behaves arrogantly, shows bad attitude towards interviewers. So, I would not
      hire this person. If I don't like the person, but I cannot identify why, then I would judge that candidate in most objective way.

      It depends on candidates performance during the interview and interview feedback.
      Also, usually we are not alone and we could have a recruiter and co-interviewers on the conversation, and we can ask their opinion.

      So, the best option it just to take a break.
