    question: 'Що таке Dependency injection? (injection tree, providedIn vs providers list)',
    answer: `
       <p>Dependency injection is a pattern that manages how and where our dependencies should be instantiated.
       It means that your class is not responsible for direct creating instance of dependency, now it's responsibility of
       some other entities. Using DI we can significantly reduce coupling between our classes and have more readable and maintainable code.</p>

       <p>When Angular tries to resolve some dependency it is looking through injection tree where are injectors are hierarchically located
       It starts from element injectors tree that goes above to module tree. And if no injectors, it throws null injector error.</p>

    question: 'Що таке Inversion of control?',
    answer: `
      <p>Abbr IoC stands for inversion of control. This pattern includes dependency injection. </p>
      <p>The main idea is: code shouldn't decide when and where to instantiate objects.
      It's better to trust it to a controlling framework, a library, or your dedicated module.
      Either of them is generally called a container.
      So container plays a controlling role: knows and care about objects lifetime, allocates and eliminates them.</p>

    answer: `The main job of the change detection mechanism is to detect the state changes and reflect the change in the User Interface.
    <br> There are two main building blocks of change detection in Angular:
