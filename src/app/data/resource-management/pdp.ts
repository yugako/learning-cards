      It's a personal preferences. But, I can try to give some arguments.

      First of all need to get the reason of this. Maybe, subordinate doesn't have a time for ASMT due to
      some personal issues, project load etc. Also, there is maybe a case when employee has a fear of ASMT. In this case, need to
      convince that actually you are not loosing anything. Another approach is to describe the benefits of getting new title.
