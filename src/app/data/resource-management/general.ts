    question: 'How do you promote company values?',
    answer: `
      When you are promoting something you can be as a role model. And the best way to promote something it is to do it by your own.
      So, as a RM I should value each person in my unit. Support them, help with development and so on. While I am working on the project I am always
      focused on customer needs and products. I cannot be fully effective working alone. So, to achieve a success we should work in teams and act as a team.
      Finally, constant improvements and self-development are crucial parts of person. We should strive for excellence.
