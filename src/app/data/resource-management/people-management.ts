    question: 'How often do you have 1-2-1? why?',
    answer: `
      It depends on risk of leaving status. If leaver once per week, if medium - once per month. By default, I am trying to have
      1-2-1 once per 2 month maximum. But, more often I am texting to subordinate just to check how the subordinate feeling, and if everything is ok. <br />

      Regular 1-to-1 is the best way to develop a strong relationship between managers and their team members. <br />

      Major events in employee's life (promotion, feedback, rotation etc.) should be discussed immediately.
      In other cases recommended minimum frequency of 1-on-1 depends on the latest risk of leaving: <br />

      Leaver – bi-weekly <br />
      Medium and High – monthly <br />
      Low – quarterly <br />
